# Pyber - Ride Sharing
## Observable Trends
* Urban cities have the highest number of rides and drivers but the lowest average fares
* Rural cities, on the other hand have the lowest number of rides and cities but the highest average fares
* If the comapany is looking for the best potential total fares they should expand into the Urban areas but if the are concerned about maximizing their profits per drive and driver, the Rural cities are a great place to start investing with the Suburban market a nice alternative.
